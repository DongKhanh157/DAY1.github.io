I am a very sociable and friendly person, would like to meet many people who share the same interests and passion for painting. I'm trying hard to practice so that I can get better and better.
	  My expertise in the field of graphic design is 2D illustration, animation and creative design of characters, content, background... Not only that, I also know a few like 3D modeling, web design. Even though I'm not a pro but I'm trying to improve every day.</p>
